This project is for the results of Cobra dataset under following methods; 

-Linear regression, 
-PCA regression 
-Lasso Regression, 
-RBF Kernel under SVR regression 
-Tanitomo Kernel under SVR regrssion
-Gradient Boosting Decision Tree

For SVR we used libsvm toolbox. It needs to be compiled. The main code includes the compilation under ubuntu.

To replicate the result for first 5 method just launch the main.m script.
Gradient Boosting Decisn tree code was written in python, please look gbdt_regression.py code.
Basically set the feature group to be used then launch that script.
